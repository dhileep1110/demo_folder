Consent Mail Trigger :

	It Occurs immediately after successful upload of an Internet Banking (IB) file.
	
	After the Internet Banking (IB) file is uploaded by the DO team,
	the system automatically sends a consent email from the DO system to the merchant owner’s email ID (provided in the IB file)
	asking the customer to confirm consent before onboarding continues
	
	
	Consent Mail Screen:
	
	Every time open the Upload menu ---> System fetches the records if consent mail is pending
	
	Consent staus screen --->  file name | Merchant Name | Expiry days | Consent_Status(Pending) | Resend button 
	

	Every time the Bulk Upload menu is opened:

		The system automatically checks for all merchants whose Consent Status = Pending in the table.

		If pending consent records exist → the Consent Mail Status screen will be displayed automatically (as a sub-screen or popup).

		If no pending consents → normal upload page opens directly.
		
		
  Page Design:

	In IB merchant upload - will show sub-screen page -----> it contains to show Consent Mail Status and Time period only Pending and ERROR
	
	 pending -- hold the records the email IDs - if limited days will expired , resend button will be show and process the resend the mail
	 
	 ERROR -- check the ValidEmail ID first, if not correct the Email ID and sent mail to it
